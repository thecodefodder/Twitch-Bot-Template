# Twitch-Bot-Template

## Idea

I Got the idea from watching a streamer with his own bot so i figured why not write my own.

This repo should help you get started making your own twitch bot.

## Can i use this?

Yes, this is ready to go! You don't need to credit me because all i did was write a few lines of code all the real work is done by the owner of the [twitchio package](https://pypi.org/project/twitchio)

## How to setup

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Go to [this website](https://twitchtokengenerator.com)
   1. Put the access token in the `TOKEN` field and [run the bot](#how-to-run)
3. Enjoy your knew twitch bot!

## How to run

### Windows
```console
py -3 main.py
```

### Linux / MacOS

```bash
python3 main.py
```

# Additional note:
Yes this is the repo for the twitch bot for my twitch channel.
